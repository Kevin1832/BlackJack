Overview

Welcome to the Blackjack Card Game! This Android Studio game brings the excitement of the classic casino experience to your android app. Test your strategy and luck as you aim to build a hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over.

Rules Hit The player can choose to hit, requesting an additional card from the dealer. The goal is to enhance the hand's value, strategically approaching the coveted 21 without exceeding it.

Stand The player can choose to stand, indicating satisfaction with their current hand. This decision reflects confidence that their hand is strong enough to compete with the dealer.

Player Busts If the total value of the player's hand exceeds 21 after taking a hit, the player busts. This results in an automatic loss, regardless of the dealer's hand.
